    <p id="fractions-text">Welcome to fractions! Here you can explore how changing the two numbers in a fraction 
        (known as the <i>numerator</i> and <i>denominator</i>) changes the size of the fraction! 
        You might notice that the big rectangle is made up of smaller rectangles. See what happens when you drag around the rectangles or change 
        how many rectangles the big rectangle has in it! How does the size of the red rectangles put together compare to the size of the large bar?</p>
